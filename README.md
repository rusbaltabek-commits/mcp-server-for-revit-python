# MCP server for Revit - Python

## A pyRevit-oriented implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Autodesk Revit

## **How?**

- This minimal implementation leverages the Routes module inside pyRevit to create a bridge between Revit and Large Language Models (LLMs).
- It provides a straightforward template to get started quickly, letting you prototype and iterate tools to give LLMs access to your Revit models.
- These tools are designed to be expanded for your specific use cases. You're very welcome to fork the repo and make your own contributions.
- **Note:** The pyRevit Routes API is currently in draft form and subject to change. It lacks built-in authentication mechanisms, so you'll need to implement your own security measures for production use.

## **Batteries Included**

This repo is aimed at:
- Beginners to the Revit API
- Python specialists who aren't versed in C#
- Anyone wanting to prototype and iterate quickly with LLMs and Revit

It contains:
- A complete Routes implementation for pyRevit
- A minimal MCP server script to connect to any MCP-compatible client
- Several test commands to get you started right away

## Key Architecture Components

The system runs as **two separate servers** working together in a chain:

```
Claude / LLM Client
       |
       |  MCP Protocol (stdio or HTTP)
       v
  main.py  (MCP Server)
       |
       |  HTTP requests (localhost:48884)
       v
  pyRevit Routes  (REST API running inside Revit)
       |
       |  Revit API calls
       v
  Revit Application
```

**`main.py`** is the MCP server. It speaks the MCP protocol so that Claude (or any MCP-compatible client) can call tools. When a tool is called, `main.py` translates it into an HTTP request and forwards it to Revit.

**pyRevit Routes** is a lightweight REST API that runs *inside* the Revit process. It receives those HTTP requests, executes Revit API code (since it has direct access to the running instance), and returns JSON responses.

They never conflict because they serve different roles, speak different protocols, and listen on different ports.

> **Note:** The Launch & Document tools (`launch_revit`, `list_revit_installations`) are the exception — they run entirely on the MCP side, using `subprocess` to start Revit and then polling the pyRevit Routes health endpoint until the bridge is ready.

1.  **MCP Server (`main.py`)**:

- Built with FastMCP
- Handles HTTP communication with Revit Routes API
- Registers tools from modular tool system
- Provides helper functions for GET/POST/Image requests

2.  **pyRevit Extension (`revit-mcp-python.extension/`)**:

- Contains the Routes API that runs inside Revit
- Modular route registration in `startup.py`
- Individual route modules in `revit_mcp/` directory

3.  **Tool Registration System (`tools/`)**:

- Modular tool organization by functionality
- Central registration through `tools/__init__.py`
- Each module registers its own tools with the MCP server

## Getting Started

### Installing uv:

> Refer to ./README_UV.md

## Installing the Extension on Revit

### Activate pyRevit Routes

1. In Revit, navigate to the pyRevit tab
2. Open Settings
3. Go to `Routes` > activate `Routes Server`
pyRevit will start listening on port `http://localhost:48884/`

### Install from pyRevit:

1. In Revit, navigate to the pyRevit tab
2. Open Extensions
3. Select the MCP Server for Revit Python Extension > Install extension
4. Select location, default is `%APPDATA%\Roaming\pyRevit\Extensions`
5. Enable and wait for pyRevit to reload. Restart Revit if necessary.


### Manual Installation on a custom directory:

1. Clone the repo in a custom location:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mcp-servers-for-revit/mcp-server-for-revit-python
    ```
2. Add `.extension` to the root folder name
3. In Revit, navigate to the pyRevit tab
4. Open Settings
5. Under "Custom Extensions", add the path to the `.extension` folder
6. Save settings and reload pyRevit (you might need to restart Revit entirely)

## Testing Your Connection

Once installed, test that the Routes API is working:

1. Open your web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:48884/revit_mcp/status/
   ```

2. If successful, you should see a response like:
   ```json
   {"status": "active",
    "health": "healthy",
    "revit_available": true,
    "document_title": "your_revit_filename",
    "api_name": "revit_mcp"}
   ```

The Routes Service will now load automatically whenever you start Revit. To disable it, simply remove the extension path from the pyRevit settings.

## Using the MCP Client

### Testing with the MCP Inspector

The MCP SDK includes a handy inspector tool for debugging:

```bash
mcp dev main.py
```

Then access `http://127.0.0.1:6274` in your browser to test your MCP server interactively.

### Transport Modes

The MCP server supports multiple transport modes for different use cases:

| Flag | Transport | Endpoints | Use Case |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| (none) | stdio | stdin/stdout | Claude Desktop / Claude Code default |
| `--sse` | SSE only | `/sse`, `/messages/` | Legacy clients |
| `--streamable-http` | HTTP only | `/mcp` | Modern HTTP clients |
| `--combined` | Both | All above | Maximum compatibility |

**Running with combined transport (recommended for HTTP):**
```bash
uv run --with "mcp[cli]" main.py --combined
```

This starts the server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with both SSE and streamable-HTTP endpoints available.

**Testing the endpoints:**
```bash
# Test streamable-http
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp

# Test SSE
curl http://localhost:8000/sse
```

### Connecting to Claude Desktop

The simplest way to install your MCP server in Claude Desktop:

```bash
mcp install main.py
```

Or for manual installation:

1. Open Claude Desktop → Settings → Developer → Edit Config
2. Add this to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Revit Connector": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/absolute/path/to/main.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For HTTP transport mode, configure Claude Desktop with:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Revit Connector": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Connecting to Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add -s user "Revit-Connector" -- uv run --with "mcp[cli]" mcp run /absolute/path/to/main.py
```

# Creating Your Own Tools

The modular architecture of this project makes adding functionalities relatively simple. The provided LLM.txt file also gives your language model the necessary context to get started right away.

The process involves three main parts:

## Part 1: Create the Route Module in Revit

Create a new Python file within the `revit-mcp-python.extension/revit_mcp/` directory (e.g., `revit_mcp/your_module.py`). This module will contain all the related functions you want to expose.

```python
# In revit-mcp-python.extension/revit_mcp/your_module.py

# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
"""
Your Module for Revit MCP
Handles your specific functionality.
"""
from pyrevit import routes, revit, DB
import json
import logging

# Standard logger setup
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def register_your_routes(api):
    """Register all your routes with the API."""

    # ---- Example 1: A GET request for reading data ----
    @api.route('/your_endpoint/', methods=["GET"])
    def get_project_title(doc):
        """Gets the project title from the Revit model."""
        try:
            value = doc.Title
            return routes.make_response(data={"status": "success", "data": value})
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("Get project title failed: {}".format(str(e)))
            return routes.make_response(data={"error": str(e)}, status=500)

    # ---- Example 2: A POST request for modifying the model ----
    @api.route('/modify_model/', methods=["POST"])
    def modify_model(doc, request):
        """Handles POST requests for modifying the Revit model."""
        try:
            data = json.loads(request.data) if isinstance(request.data, str) else request.data

            # Use a transaction for all model modifications
            t = DB.Transaction(doc, "Modify Model via MCP")
            t.Start()

            try:
                element_id = data.get("element_id")
                new_value = data.get("new_value")
                element = doc.GetElement(DB.ElementId(int(element_id)))
                param = element.LookupParameter("Comments")
                param.Set(new_value)

                t.Commit()
                return routes.make_response(data={"status": "success", "result": "Element modified."})

            except Exception as tx_error:
                if t.HasStarted() and not t.HasEnded():
                    t.RollBack()
                raise tx_error

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("Modify model failed: {}".format(str(e)))
            return routes.make_response(data={"error": str(e)}, status=500)

    logger.info("Your custom routes were registered successfully.")
```

## Part 2: Create the MCP Tool Module

Create the corresponding tools for the MCP server in the `tools/` directory (e.g., `tools/your_tools.py`). This module will use the `revit_get` and `revit_post` helpers from `main.py`.

```python
# In tools/your_tools.py
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""Your tools for the MCP server."""

from mcp.server.fastmcp import Context
from .utils import format_response

def register_your_tools(mcp, revit_get, revit_post, revit_image=None):
    """Register your tools with the MCP server."""

    # ---- Tool for the GET request ----
    @mcp.tool()
    async def get_revit_project_title(ctx: Context) -> str:
        """
        Retrieves the title of the currently open Revit project.
        """
        response = await revit_get("/your_endpoint/", ctx)
        return format_response(response)

    # ---- Tool for the POST request ----
    @mcp.tool()
    async def modify_revit_element_comment(
        element_id: int,
        new_value: str,
        ctx: Context = None
    ) -> str:
        """
        Modifies the 'Comments' parameter of a specific element.

        Args:
            element_id: The ID of the element to modify.
            new_value: The new comment to apply to the element.
        """
        payload = {"element_id": element_id, "new_value": new_value}
        response = await revit_post("/modify_model/", payload, ctx)
        return format_response(response)
```

## Part 3: Register Your New Modules

### 1. Register the Route Module

Open `revit-mcp-python.extension/startup.py` and add your new route registration function.

```python
# In revit-mcp-python.extension/startup.py

# ... (other imports)
# Import the registration function from your new module
from revit_mcp.your_module import register_your_routes

def register_routes():
    """Register all MCP route modules"""
    api = routes.API('revit_mcp')
    try:
        # ... (existing route registrations)

        # Register your new routes (this registers all functions inside)
        register_your_routes(api)

        logger.info("All MCP routes registered successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error("Failed to register MCP routes: {}".format(str(e)))
        raise
```

### 2. Register the Tool Module

Open `tools/__init__.py` and add your new tool registration function.

```python
# In tools/__init__.py

# ... (other tool imports)
# Import the registration function from your new tool module
from .your_tools import register_your_tools

def register_tools(mcp_server, revit_get_func, revit_post_func, revit_image_func):
    """Register all tools with the MCP server"""

    # ... (existing tool registrations)
    # Register your new tools (this registers all tools inside)
    register_your_tools(mcp_server, revit_get_func, revit_post_func, revit_image_func)

    return mcp_server
```


## Roadmap
